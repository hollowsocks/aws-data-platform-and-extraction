---

## Remaining Work Snapshot

- **EventBridge deployment:** Supply partner source name plus the five Lambda image URIs, deploy `infrastructure/shopify/eventbridge-rules.yaml`, and validate DLQs/permissions in staging.
- **Secrets & config:** Populate Secrets Manager entries (`ShopifyAdminApiSecret`, `RechargeWebhookSecret`), grant IAM access, and update Lambda environment variables to resolve the secrets at runtime.
- **Bulk & Recharge orchestration:** Deploy `infrastructure/shopify/shopify-bulk-workflow.yaml` and `infrastructure/recharge/recharge-webhook.yaml`, then hook the Recharge portal to the new invoke URL and confirm Step Functions execution.
- **Monitoring rollout:** Launch `infrastructure/monitoring/monitoring.yaml`, subscribe the operations email to `${Brand}-data-platform-alerts`, and backfill dashboards with initial metrics.
- **Glue ETL job:** Upload `glue-scripts/orders_enriched_job.py` to the artifact bucket, deploy `infrastructure/shopify/glue-jobs.yaml`, and validate the on-demand run (or schedule) writes to `processed/shopify/orders_enriched/`.
- **Data quality checks:** Build/push the data-quality container image, deploy `infrastructure/data-quality/data-quality.yaml`, and confirm scheduled executions publish metrics and alerts.
- **CI/CD enablement:** Configure GitHub Action secrets, keep `ci/environments/prod/<job>/` parameter files up to date, and extend `ci/ingestion_jobs.json` as additional ingestion jobs are onboarded.
- **Shopify partner actions:** Create/activate EventBridge webhooks, accept the partner source in AWS, and confirm event delivery through to the order/customer/cart processors.

## CI/CD Strategy
- Standardize deployments through GitHub Actions workflows.
- Maintain environment-specific workflows (dev, staging, prod) with required approvals before promotion.
- Ensure IaC validation (cfn-lint, taskcat) and application tests run within the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- Store AWS credentials via OpenID Connect and scoped IAM roles; avoid long-lived keys.
- Capture deployment artifacts (logs, change records) as build outputs for audit trails.

## Tracking Guidance
- Update this backlog weekly alongside your work tracking tool (e.g., Jira).
- Mirror Story IDs in your ticketing system to maintain traceability.
- During sprint planning, set Status/Owner/Priority values and adjust estimates as delivery data improves.
- Capture evidence links (reports, dashboards, runbooks) in the Deliverables section as progress is made.
- Revisit Risks quarterly and after major incidents to ensure mitigations remain effective.
